# Disclaimer

The code provided in this repository can't be exxecuted without the use of an IDE. Requirements are easyguy, json and random, all of which can be installed via ```bash pip install (package name)```.

However, I am working on an executable for both widows (.EXE), as well as one for unix (.pkg).
